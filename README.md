  - useState(): a hook that allows you to add state to a functional component.
  - useEffect(): a hook that allows you to perform side effects in a functional component, such as fetching data.
  - memo(): a higher-order component that can optimize performance by memoizing the result of a component and only re-rendering it when necessary.
  - lazy(): a function that allows you to lazy-load a component, meaning that it will only be loaded when needed.
  - Supense: a component that allows you to suspend rendering while waiting for asynchronous data to load.
